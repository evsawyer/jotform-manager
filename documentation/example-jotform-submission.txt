Arbitration is a simplified means of pursuing legal claims, where the claim is decided by an arbitrator rather than a judge or jury. You authorize the Firm to settle your individual claim(s) with e.l.f. for a reasonable amount and execute a release of your individual claim(s) on your behalf. However, this agreement also authorizes the Firm to settle and release your claim(s) as a part of a class action if e.l.f. chooses to do so. In the event that the Firm enters a settlement with your authority and you choose not to participate in the settlement, you may reject the settlement and the Firm may withdraw its representation of you. You further authorize the Firm to represent additional individuals who have claims that are the same or similar to yours against e.l.f.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe Firm will handle this matter with a contingent fee of the greater of either forty percent (40%), as allowed by state law, of any recovery obtained in this matter or total attorneys’ fees awarded by the arbitrator or court. The Firm reserves the right to associate with co-counsel, but the fee will be split between the Firm and any additional firm(s) they associate with.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe Firm will advance all costs incurred by the Firm during this litigation (e.g., filing fees, travel, etc.). The Firm will be reimbursed for these costs if, and only if, they ultimately obtain a recovery on your behalf. Advanced costs are deducted after the calculation of the contingent fee.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThe Firm will keep you informed about the progress of your claim as it moves forward. We will do so via phone calls, emails, and SMS messages. By signing this retainer agreement, you consent to the Firm calling and sending case-related SMS messages to the cell phone number you provided when signing up for representation. If at any time you no longer wish to receive phone calls from the Firm, you can email us at arbitration.clientcare@brysonpllc.com. Similarly, if you no longer wish to receive SMS messages from the Firm, you can reply “STOP” to any SMS message to opt out of receiving additional messages.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EYou authorize the Firm to withdraw from representation if they determine for sufficient reasons that your claim(s) should not continue. Regardless, the Firm will maintain the file on this matter for at least six years. If requested, these will be returned to you after the conclusion of the representation.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EFinally, the Firm does not make any promises or guarantees regarding the outcome of your claim(s).
