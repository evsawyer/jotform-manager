Overview

The Jotform API makes it possible to connect to your form data without using the Jotform web site.

The Jotform API is written for Jotform users and 3rd party developers who would like to serve Jotform users. For example, Zapier uses the Jotform API to connect form submission data with other services.

Care to tell us how you would like to use Jotform API? Feel free to fill this form. We'd be happy to help you—we’ll even assign a developer to help you with your task!

API Endpoints

You can access our API through the following URLs:

Standard API Usage: Use the default API URL: https://api.jotform.com
For EU: Use the EU API URL: https://eu-api.jotform.com
For HIPAA: Use the HIPAA API URL: https://hipaa-api.jotform.com

Upgrade to Enterprise to make your API url your-domain.com/API or subdomain.jotform.com/API instead of api.jotform.com Learn more about Jotform Enterprise

Getting Started

To get started using Jotform API you need a valid API key. Obtaining an API key is very simple.

1. Go to My Account
2. Navigate to API Section
3. Create a new API Key

Get started with the Jotform API by using an API library in the language of your choice. See libraries section for a complete list.

Authentication
The Jotform API supports more than one authentication method to simplify the authentication process in different programming languages.

1. Authenticate with Query Parameters
You can send your API Key with your query as a parameter

GET An example call to get user details


curl -X GET "https://api.jotform.com/user?apiKey={myApiKey}"

POST An example call to setup a new webhook


curl -X POST -d "webhookURL=http://my.webhook.url/connect-to-DB.ext" -d "apiKey={myApiKey}" "https://api.jotform.com/v1/form/{myFormID}/webhooks"

2. Authenticate with HTTP Headers
You can send your API Key with your query as a HTTP header

An example call to get user details by HTTP header


curl -H "APIKEY: {myApiKey}" "https://api.jotform.com/user"

3. Authenticate with Javascript SDK
You can authenticate users through Jotform by using our Javascript SDK.

1. First, you should call JF.login() to launch a login form within an iFrame pop-up to prompt a user to sign-in. If the user authenticates successfully, (s)he will be asked to allow permissions to access to her account. You can pass callback functions to JF.login for both successful and failed authorizations. 

<script src="https://js.jotform.com/JotForm.js"></script>
<script>
//JF.login(success, error) method takes two optional arguments
//Both arguments should be function 
//First argument will be called after successful login
//Second argument will be called if authorization fails
JF.login(
function success(){
JF.getForms(function(response){
for(var i=0; i<response.length; i++){
document.write( "<li> " + response[i].title);
}
});
},
function error(){
window.alert("Could not authorize user");
}
); 
</script> 

2. At this point, we can use the API to perform actions. But, what if we want to be able to store this authentication so that we can use it in the future? To be able to do that, you need to get the user's API key and save it in your servers. In order to obtain API key from SDK, call JF.getAPIKey method.

var apiKey = JF.getAPIKey();
console.log(apiKey); //should log currently used API key



Once you have the API key, you can call JF.initialize({apiKey: "123456789"}) and then call any other API methods. Note that JF.login method will automatically call initialize method after successful login.

JF.initialize( {apiKey: "123456789"} );

Installation Notes

PHP Client Library


Simply download Jotform.php into your application path and include in your php file as:

include "../Jotform.php";


More info available on repository page at Github.


Python Client Library


There is currently no package submitted to PyPi. You need to download and import jotform.py as follows.

from jotform import JotformAPIClient


More info available on repository page at Github.


Java Client Library


Java client library is not available as a '.jar' file so you have to copy the folder structure of Jotform Java package into your project. Jotform API Java client uses Apache HTTP Client 4.2.5 and org.json packages. So in order to work with the api client you need to add them to your project.

First check out the git repository and add the following files into your src folder as:

/src/com/jotform/api/JotformAPIWrapper.java
/src/com/jotform/api/JotformException.java
/src/com/jotform/api/samples/GetTodaysSubmissions.java
/src/com/jotform/api/samples/PrintFormList.java
/src/org/json/JSONArray.java
/src/org/json/JSONException.java
/src/org/json/JSONObject.java
/src/org/json/JSONString.java
/src/org/json/JSONStringer.java
/src/org/json/JSONTokener.java
/src/org/json/JSONWriter.java


Then copy the contents of the /lib/ folder into your project with the same path.

/lib/commons-logging-1.1.1.jar
/lib/httpclient-4.2.5.jar
/lib/httpcore-4.2.4.jar


Then you will need to add these .jars into your buildpath. If you are using eclipse, you can simply right click on each jar file and click Build Path->Add To Build Path. If the jars are not visible in your project explorer even though you copied them into your lib/ folder, try right clicking on your project in Package Explorer and then clicking refresh.

More information available on repository page at Github.

Javascript Client Library Copy and paste the script below to your page
<script src="https://js.jotform.com/JotForm.js"></script>

NodeJS Client Library
npm install jotform


More information available on repository page at Github.
